# rpgCraftPermissions
A plugin that allows you to create a group of items (name and access level) and permissions that are needed to create items from this group. Items can be added to the "white list" and they will be available for everyone to create. Also, this plugin makes it possible to give players permissions to use blocks (furnace, anvil, enchanting table, etc.) that are not included in the "white list".
